                  there is a booktitle presenting the name of the TV

                  recommends that the list of references contain only

                  (\cmslink{white:total}, below), with any further
                  information being provided as part of the running
                  text.  (If you follow this method, then the

                  If, for some reason, you still want to cite
                  individual letters in the list of references, this
                  and the \cmslink{white:russ} entry demonstrate how

                  entries using \textsf{crossref} or \textsf{xref} (as
                  in \textsf{InCollection} and \textsf{InProceedings}
                  entries), so the information printed in the list of
                  references will be abbreviated.  You can simply use
                  the \textsf{origdate} field for the date of the
                  letter, and you'll get separate letters, ordered by
                  date, and with a,b,c, etc. appended to differentiate
